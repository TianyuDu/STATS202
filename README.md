### Data Analysis on PANSS Dataset

## Data

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (**PANSS**) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. Raw and cleaned datasets are located at `./data/`

## Tasks

The final project consisted of four sub-tasks: testing for treatment effect, clustering patients, classifying assessment validity, and forecasting further PANSS scores. 

A more detailed description of the four tasks for this project (mentioned above) can be found in the instruction document at `./final_project.pdf`
