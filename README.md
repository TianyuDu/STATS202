# Final Project of STATS202 @ Stanford University

>  STATS202: Data Mining and Analysis

## Data Analysis on PANSS Dataset

## Data

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (**PANSS**) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. Raw and cleaned datasets are located at `./data/`.

Please note that datasets `./data/Study_[A, B, C, D].csv` are labelled training sets, while `./data/Study_E.csv` is unlabelled testing sets.

## Tasks

The final project consisted of four sub-tasks: testing for treatment effect, clustering patients, classifying assessment validity, and forecasting further PANSS scores. 

A more detailed description of the four tasks for this project (mentioned above) can be found in the instruction document at [`./final_project.pdf`](./final_project.pdf)
